# PoshMark Auto Reshare
==========================
- Short Python Script to auto share on poshmark, written for my wife.

  ### REQUIRES TO RUN IN DEBUG MODE, WITH BREAK POINT SET.
- set break on print for captcha, yes I know this is a stupid way of catching but whatever
- TODO
  - Fix how captcha is handled, make dynamic.
  - add support for checks for random MFA requests when logging in
  - Fix static timed pauses, change to dynamic based on page response time
  - Make it not suck.

logs in, goes to closet, selects only available items and reshares.
